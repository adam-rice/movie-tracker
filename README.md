# Film Favs

An application built using redux, react, &amp; react-router. The API used for gathering movie information comes from [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en).

A user can create an account or log in with an existing account, view movies that are currently playing in theaters, and add movies from the Now Playing list to a their own Favorites list.

Built by [Adam Rice](https://github.com/adam-rice), [Elijah Williams](https://github.com/ejwill04), &amp; [Eric Saylor](https://github.com/esayler) during module three at the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://www.turing.io/).
